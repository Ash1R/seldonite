Despite being close allies, Saudi Arabia and the neighbouring UAE are competing to attract investors and businesses. Saudi Arabia - the biggest importer in the region - is trying to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil, while providing more jobs for its own citizens, a point also covered by the rule changes announced at the weekend.

The two countries’ national interests have increasingly diverged, such as in their relations with Israel and Turkey. They have also faced off in the last few days about a proposed OPEC+ deal to raise oil output.

Saudi Arabia will henceforth exclude from the GCC tariff agreement goods made by companies with a workforce made up of less than 25% of local people and industrial products with less than 40% of added value after their transformation process.

The ministerial decree published on the Saudi official gazette Umm al-Qura said all goods made in free zones in the region will not be considered locally made.

Free zones, a major driver of the UAE’s economy, are areas in which foreign companies can operate under light regulation, and where foreign investors are allowed to take 100% ownership in companies.

According to the decree, goods that contain a component made or produced in Israel or manufactured by companies owned fully or partially by Israeli investors or by companies listed in the Arab boycott agreement regarding Israel, will be disqualified.

The UAE and Israel signed a tax treaty last May as both sides work to spur on business development after normalising relations last year. Bahrain, another GCC member, has also normalised ties with Israel under the so-called “Abraham Accords” crafted by the administration of then U.S.-President Donald Trump.

“The idea once was to create a GCC market, but now there’s the realisation that the priorities of Saudi Arabia and the UAE are very different,” said Amir Khan, senior economist at Saudi National Bank.

“This regulation is putting flesh on the bone of these political divergences,” he said.

In February, the Saudi government said it will stop giving state contracts to businesses that base their Middle East hubs in any other country in the region. That was a blow to Dubai, one of the UAE’s emirates, which has built its economy on its open-for-business credentials and the promise of a glitzy lifestyle for well-heeled expatriates.

‘INCREASED COMPETITION’

Saudi Arabia has announced the latest rule changes despite the fact that UAE is its second-biggest trade partner after China in terms of import value, based on recent Saudi trade data.

It is also a major re-exporting hub for foreign products to Saudi Arabia, including Turkish goods - which have been under an unofficial boycott by Riyadh.

Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been at loggerheads since the 2011 Arab uprisings, when Riyadh accused Ankara of supporting Islamist political groups. Tensions escalated in 2018 over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate.

The ministerial decree said companies with a local workforce of between 10% and 25% of the total could compensate the difference by increasing the industrial added value in their products and vice versa. The added value should not be less than 15% in any case to benefit from the preferential tariff agreement, it added.

“The original customs union agreement, established Jan 2003, no longer serves the needs of the GCC countries ... including Saudi and the UAE and in light of the increased competition between the two countries pursuing similar non-oil diversification activities,” said Nasser Saidi, a Dubai-based economist.

“The current dispute, while disruptive in the short-term, can open the door to a more efficient, modern, trade and investment framework and agreement that would boost growth prospects and allow for greater diversification, higher value-added regional trade,” he said.

Saudi Arabia’s energy minister pushed back on Sunday against opposition by the UAE to a proposed OPEC+ deal and called for “compromise and rationality” to secure agreement when the group reconvenes on Monday.

OPEC+ members voted on Friday to raise output by some 2 million barrels per day from August to December 2021 and extend remaining cuts to the end of 2022 but the UAE’s objections have stalled the deal."

PARIS, July 29 (Reuters) - Europe’s Airbus doubled its full-year profit forecast and raised the outlook for jet deliveries after posting better-than-expected half-year results, pushing its shares to the highest level since the start of the coronavirus crisis.

The world’s largest planemaker said it was benefiting from the beginnings of a recovery in air travel demand, but cautioned that uneven global vaccination rates and the spreading Delta variant of COVID-19 left uncertainty over the recovery.

Airbus said it expected to deliver 600 aircraft in 2021, up from a previous target of at least 566, and doubled its forecast for operating income to 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) while predicting 2 billion euros of free cashflow.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Airbus would deliver more than 600 jets this year after negotiating workarounds with cash-strapped airlines, including deals that allow some to delay accounting for new planes on their balance sheets.

“COVID-19 is not over,” Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told reporters on Thursday.

“Levels of vaccinations are very diverse around the world and we cannot exclude that after the Delta variant there will be another one, so we believe we have to remain very prudent,” he said, adding: “It is going to a bumpy road in terms of recovery.”

Even so, shares in the Paris-listed heavyweight rose as much as 4.9%, helping to propel European shares to record highs.

Stifel analyst Harry Breach said the stronger outlook reflected a growing share of high-margin A321neo jets in deliveries as well as the depth of cost cuts at Airbus, which is completing pandemic-related plans to reduce up to 15,000 jobs.

Led by its commercial aerospace and helicopter divisions, Airbus swung to an operating profit of 2.01 billion euros in the second quarter, compared with a loss of 1.23 billion a year earlier, as revenue rose 70% to 14.18 billion euros.

For the first half, Airbus posted operating earnings of 2.70 billion euros, eclipsing its previous full-year goal.

Analysts were on average expecting 1.59 billion euros of operating profit on revenue of 14 billion euros in the second quarter, according to a company-compiled consensus.

Its rival Boeing on Wednesday posted its first quarterly profit in almost two years as revived domestic travel fuelled 737 MAX deliveries. Its shares rose 5%.

Both planemakers face concerns about the slow recovery of long-haul travel. A pickup is badly needed to revive demand for wide-bodied jets that was sagging even before the crisis.

Airbus announced the launch of an A350 freighter in a bid to break Boeing’s longstanding dominance of a lucrative but volatile part of the jet market, which has benefited from growth in e-commerce during the pandemic.

It has not yet secured orders for the new plane, which it expects to deliver to the first customer in 2025."

BARCELONA, July 26 (Reuters) - Spanish drugmaker Almirall reported an unexpected first-half loss on Monday after it had written down the value of its anti-acne drug Seysara, sending its shares down as much as 9% despite an improved earnings outlook.

The group, which specialises in dermatology treatments, said the net loss of 42.8 million euros ($50.41 million) was mainly triggered by a 100 million euro write-down from the value of Seysara. Chief Financial Officer Mike McClellan told investors the group lowered its estimates for the drug’s sales growth.

Almirall’s shares were down 9% at 13.60 euros in midday trading.

The swing into the red from a 42.4 million euro net profit reported in the first half of 2020, was not expected by the consensus estimates while the upgraded forecast fell below market expectations, CM Capital Markets analysts said in a report.

The Barcelona-based company said it now expected its core annual earnings at between 195 million euros and 215 million euros, up 5 million euros from the previous target range.

Almirall’s first half revenue dipped 1.2% compared with the same period of 2020, dented by lower sales in the United States, where it faces stiff competition from generic drug makers. Core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) inched down to 136.6 million euros from 137.2 million euros.

However, second quarter EBITDA improved to 62.4 million euros from 48.9 million euros in the same period of 2020, coming above 57 million euros forecast in a Refinitiv poll.

Despite the first-half setback chief executive Gianfranco Nazzi offered a positive take on the rest of the year.

“The strength of our results confirms that we are progressing as expected, with an innovative pipeline,” Nazzi said in a statement, adding the company was preparing significant launches in the second half and looking at more opportunities."
