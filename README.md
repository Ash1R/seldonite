# Seldonite
### A News Event Representation Library

Define a news source, set your search method, and create event representations.

Usage (WIP):
```python
from seldonite import source, collect, represent

sites = ['cbc.ca', 'bbc.com']
source = source.CommonCrawl(sites)

collector = collect.Collector(source)
collector.by_keywords(['afghanistan', 'withdrawal'])
news = collector.fetch()

timeline = represent.Timeline(news)
timeline.show()
```

Please see the wiki for more detail on sources and methods

## Setup

To install seldonite as editable, and dependencies via pip:
```
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or if you have `make`:
```
make setup
```

### Spacy

To use NLP methods that require the use of spacy:
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Selenium

To use sources that require Selenium, download the chromedriver and place is on your path. For me this goes like this:
```
curl -LO https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/94.0.4606.61/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unzip ./chromedriver_linux64.zip
mv ./chromedriver /path/to/bin
rm chromedriver_linux64.zip
```

### Spark

To make Python dependencies available to Spark executors, use venv:
```
conda env create -f ./environment.yml
conda activate pyspark_conda_env
conda pack -f -o pyspark_conda_env.tar.gz
```
then in the Python code:
```
os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = './environment/bin/python'
conf.set('spark.archives', 'pyspark_conda_env.tar.gz#environment)
```

## Tests

We use `pytest`.

To run tests, run these commands from the top level directory:

```
pip install -e .
pytest
```

Or: 
```
make test
```
